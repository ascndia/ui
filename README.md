# ascndia

instead of using ui library and build your section/BLOCKS/pages from scratch. why not use ascndia?

instead of delivering UI components. we focus on delivering high quality and customizable BLOCKS and SECTIONS so you can focus on functionality.

this web and functionality was built using shadcn/ui as starting point and still in growing stage.

this app Will be forever open source. contributor are welcomed ðŸ˜¼
